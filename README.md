- 👋 Hi, I’m @LazySloppyGames and I created this account to share small, quickly programmed games that I made. And as the title mentions, the syntax isn't going to win any awards, but it gets the job done.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about programming by practicing creating these games.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, JavaScript, React, and more.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... I never thought about collaborating on any of this, but I'm definitely open if someone is interested.
- 📫 How to reach me... I'll probably create an extra email for this later. I'll link any social media sites that have contact points here in the future.
