- 👋 @LazySloppyGames here. I created this account to share small, quickly programmed games that I made. And as my username may suggest, the syntax isn't going to win any awards, but it gets the job done.
- 
- 👀 I learn more about programming by picking something that looks interesting (usually a game) and trying to figure out how to make it.
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, JavaScript, React... I play around with Python and Pygame, C++ and SDL, etc. Usually a Windows/Linux person. Tried the Mac thing but found it too restrictive. Would love to work more on apps.
- 
- 💞️ I've never thought about collaborating. Then again, I've never taken on a project of that magnitude. Mostly I just do what I do for fun, and hopefully someone else gets something (entertainment or a cheap laugh at my programming skills) out of it.
- 
- 📫 As for contacting me (who the heck would want to?), here is a link to a YouTube channel I made a while back. Nothing really on it right now: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI-yvwjHjvVsJe2GyB9dAzg
